        <h3>Homeschool Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            My father has allowed me the space to discover what my interests are and then use those interests as a launch pad for my education. My homeschooling journey started out rocky but it has since improved.
        </p>
		<p> Since we are not doing traditional school the learning days are not structured and I am allowed a lot of freedom to explore my interests. There was a significant adjustment period where I was always looking for a teacher or adult to tell me what to do and when to do it and at first it was difficult to just do things on my own but after a while I think I have adjusted and now I am much better at being independent.</p>
		<p>
			We spend significant time on foundational subjects like Mathematics, English Language Arts (ELA), and Social Studies and History. We also do Science and other things like physical education.

        <h3>Subjects and Resources</h3>
        <h4>Mathematics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I started lessons using various textbooks and now rely heavily on 
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/progress" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. My dad is a math teacher so he is my primary resource.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have also completed a lot of 
                <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/uJPTsTzgx8KPmcDg6" target="_blank">worksheets</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Social Studies/History</h4>
        <ul>

        </ul>
		<p> 

        <h4>ELA</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>We aim to build reading, writing, and critical thinking skills for ELA. I have been given the room to be creative and express myself while we explore different kinds of books and texts, which helps me understand and analyze what I read.</li>
            <li>Books Iâ€™ve read so far include a mix of literature and non-fiction texts.</li>
        </ul>
